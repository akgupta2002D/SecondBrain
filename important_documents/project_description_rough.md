I have been working on a project called Second Brain. This was inspired by the book Second Brain and it is aimed at creating a space for me to keep my past, track my present, and plan for my future. This is my dream project. This app has two big goals, one to implement and enhance my technical competence in programming, web dev, and UI/UX along with CI/CD. Secondly, this app has a pure purpose in my life as to be an companion to help maintain and improve many aspects of my life. I will be creating apps for all aspects of my life in this django project. ------- Some key things about this project are: I have maintained industry standard for developing this app. I have separated the creation of each app in the following steps: 1. Write a motivation behind why I want to create this app. Evaluate feasibility of this app.
2. Write a rough specification in text file. Include how it is intended to work and other relevant things. 
3. Create a FlowChart regarding the app logic - Also include how it will sit in the overall secondBrain App. This will result in creating a flowchart that clearly defines views, URLs, templates required. We would also utilize UML diagrams to enhance the planning process. This phase would also require me to create the mockups for models.
4. Create a Figma Diagram regarding the UI/UX.
5. Start Building the app - document along the way. -------------------------------- While doing all of this, I have effectively used github to version control my production of this app. -------- Some of the major technologies used are: Django , Django jinja2, HTML, CSS, javascript, Django signals and asynchronous processing, and many more relevant technologies. ---------- I have worked continuously to build this app which incorporates many apps at different aspects of life: 1. Project Related: Note Taking, Robust project based todolist, github stats tracking using API, project document management.
2. Health related: Workout planner and streak tracker, Food and Nutrition, Health records
3. Utilities App: OCR image to text, text to questions, summarizers and links saving.
4. Knowledge Repository:
5. Journaling and Reflection:
6. Birthday tracking for friends and family, Important dates tracking, 
7. Email Writing templates, 
8. Notification Center - collects all of my notification in one place.
And more than 50+ apps helping me regularly. A lot of them include sending API calls to many other apps as well. I have also implemented a robust role-based authentication system. Lastly, I have deployed this app using AWS EC2 instance along with RDS and S3 bucket. I have also used ngnix and gunicorn for deploying my django app. I have learnt a lot during this process of building this app and I have regularly been working on this app even now. This is a growing life project for me. For easier access this is also mobile friendly and PWA feature.
