# SecondBrain
This is my second brain that knows my past, tracks things that I am doing in present, and inspires/stores my aspirations for future. I will be creating small apps for each feature I want in my secondBrain.

# Rules
-> I recognize this a long term project and I want to build this for my life and not just for getting a job.
-> I will commit atleast once everyday on this repository as a show of commitment.

# Steps to create each app
1. Write a motivation behind why I want to create this app. 
2. Write a rough specification in text file. Include how it is intended to work and other relevant things.

4. Create a Figma Diagram regarding the UI/UX.
5. Start Building the app - document along the way.
