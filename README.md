# SecondBrain
This is my second brain that knows my past, tracks things that I am doing in present, and inspires/stores my aspirations for future. I will be creating small apps for each feature I want in my secondBrain.

# Rules
* I recognize this a long term project and I want to build this for my life and not just for getting a job.
* I will commit atleast once everyday on this repository as a show of commitment.

# Steps to create each app
1. Write a motivation behind why I want to create this app. 
2. Write a rough specification in text file. Include how it is intended to work and other relevant things.
3. Create a FlowChart regarding the app logic - Also include how it will sit in the overall secondBrain App.
4. Create a Figma Diagram regarding the UI/UX.
5. Start Building the app - document along the way.

# First App - The Base Layout
Motivation  - This is just a temporary structure of the second brain. Just so that we a dock for every app we will make moving on.
Jan 21st    - If I keep looking at videos to make the best dashboard, I will be old.
            - I will just make a layout for now. 
[Read the documentation for the Base Layout](/App_Documentation/BaseLayout/BaseLayout.md)
Completed: 23rd June

# Second App - Authentication
There will be a simple implementation of an authentiation system based on Django Auth.
It will allow users to register, login, and logout of the app.
[Read the documentation for the Authentication Layout](/App_Documentation/Authentication/authentication.md)
Completed: 24th June

# Third App - Commit Tracker
This is a simple add-on like app that just tracks my commit messages.

# Fourth App - Todo App
First App I will be working on will be a TodoApp that helps me work effectively.
For each apps, here are the steps I will follow:


# Fifth App - Render a 3d model 

# Sixth App - Dragable Div - Dictionary
